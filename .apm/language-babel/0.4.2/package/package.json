The color of syntax is determined by the theme in use.\n\n[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) ( previously known as 6to5 ) support is baked in. Options in the\nlanguage-babel settings allow for compilation on the fly, plus full transpiler control and output.\n\n##Installation\n\nInstall via ATOM `File -> settings-> + install`, or by using `apm install language-babel`\n\n##Usage\n\nBy default the language-babel package will detect file types `.js`,`.babel`,`.jsx` and `es6`. Use the standard ATOM interface to enable it for other file types. This provides a grammar that scopes the file in order to highlight text in a meaningful way.\n\nBy default the package also supports the [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) transpiler. Out of the box any file saved will be transpiled and any errors and/or successful completions notified in the ATOM workspace.\n\nIt is most likely many users of Babel will use a workflow ( grunt, gulp, etc ) and will not want transpiled output saved. However, language-babel fully supports transpiled output, maps, and the setting of most Babel options. See Advanced Usage below for more information.\n\n##Screen Images\n\nThis shows language babel using the default atom-dark color scheme.\n\n![Image inserted by Atom editor package auto-host-markdown-image](http://i.imgur.com/OPZwVv8.gif)\n\n![Image inserted by Atom editor package auto-host-markdown-image](http://i.imgur.com/bMXR0i1.gif)\n\n![Image inserted by Atom editor package auto-host-markdown-image](http://i.imgur.com/TAi2cAk.gif)\n\n##Advanced Usage\n\nBy using the ATOM settings panel for language-babel you can control many of the operations of the transpiler.\n\n* ####Transpile On Save\n  On any file save of a language-babel enabled file the Babel transpiler  is called. Any errors and/or successful indications are notified by a ATOM pop-up.\n\n* ####Create Transpiled Code\n  If enabled the transpile phase will output Javascript code to a `.js` file with the same prefix as the original. By using the `path` options below it is possible to transpile to a different target directory.\n\n* ####Create Map\n  A source map can be generated as required. The source file name will be used with a new suffix of `.js.map`. To avoid any possible XSSI issues the map file is prefixed with `)]}`\n\n* ####Babel Maps Add Url\n  If a source map is created this allows a Url reference `//# sourceURL=originalBabelSourcefile` to be appended to the generated Javascript file.  \n\n* ####Babel Source Path, Babel Transpile Path and Babel Maps Path\n  These a directories based on the project root. ATOM now supports more than one project root folder, so these paths are based on each project root folder.\n\n  Only files found under the `project/babelsourcepath` will be candidates for transpilation. If multiple project root folders exist then `babelsourcepath` may exist in any or all folders.\n\n  The Transpile and Maps paths allow different target directories to be specified. If multiple project root folders exist then they may exist in any or all folders.\n\n  e.g. Two project root folders exist `/proj1` and `/proj2`. If Source Path is set to `babelSource`the Transpile Path is set to `babelTranspile` and the Maps Path is set to `babelMaps` then:-\n\n  `/proj1/babelSource/foo.es6` ->`/proj1/babelTranspile/foo.js`,`/proj1/babelMaps/foo.js.map`\n\n  `/proj2/babelSource/dirBar/foo.es6` -> `/proj2/babelTranspile/dirBar/foo.js`,`/proj2/babelMaps/dirBar/foo.js.map`\n\n* ####Create Target Directories\n  When enabled any target directories that do not exist will be created prior to a transpilation.\n\n* ####Babel Stage\n  The ECMA standards stage to enforce. The default is 2. See [Babel Stages](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/) for more information.\n\n* #### External Helpers\n  When enabled transpiled output will not include babel helper code.   Please refer to [Babel External Helpers](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/external-helpers/) for further information.\n\n* ####Module Loader\n  The module loader format to use. Either `common` to use CommonJS, `amd` to use Asynchronous Module Definition or `umd` to use Universal Module Definition   Please refer to [Babel Modules](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/modules/) for further information.\n\n* ####Transformer Options\n  The remaining transformer options may contain comma seperated lists of transformer names.\n  Please refer to [Babel Transformers](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/transformers/) and [Babel Runtime](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/runtime/) for further information.\n\n###About\n\nThe grammar for this package is based upon [Babel-Sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime). The JSX grammar has been reworked to allow for checking of balanced equal tag names plus other small changes.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gandm/language-babel/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gandm/language-babel","_id":"language-babel@0.4.2","_shasum":"42df01fab05544d4292055ee8436806aa6a5a551","_resolved":"file:../d-115329-10928-ouk8m2/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115329-10928-ouk8m2/package.tgz"}
